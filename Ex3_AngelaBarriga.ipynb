    "I'm Spanish and I'm in Spain at the moment, sadly we are the most infected country in Europe right now. While I've been lucky enough to have most of my family and friends safe and healthy, a couple of my best friends got the virus. They are fine and they didn't require serious medical help but they have lost their smell and taste senses (anosmia and ageusia in medical terms). These symptomps are becoming more and more common (https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/12/health/smell-taste-coronavirus-pandemic-wellness-intl-gbr/index.html) but there's very little research about them and doctors don't know for how long the senses are gone or which treatment might work. My friends have already been one month and a half with no smell or taste at all. While they are healthy apart from this, it is quite a cumbersome situation, it affects their daily lives and mental health, since they don't know when they will recover.\n",

      "Summary  Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure  [2, 3] The main purpose of fit testing is to ensure that the respirator being used by the individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect the person from unwanted airborne hazard exposures  Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable  We report a case that required hospitalization for a severe asthmatic reaction related to denatonium benzoate fit testing The limitation of this study was that there was no specific patch testing, specific inhalation challenge, and specific IgE measurements with the ingredient of denatonium benzoate because the survival of this patient was the priority On October 13, 2017, she was hospitalized and initially treated with diphenhydramine 30 mg st (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr 100 mg st and prn (inhalation), and prednisolone 10 mg/daily (oral) for 7 days  She was rushed to the emergency room and treated with prednisolone 10 mg daily, fenoterol HBr 100 mg (inhalation), and montelukast 10 mg daily  Another study [3] in Canada presented several cases related to the use of denatonium benzoate for respirator fit testing  Respirator fit testing was performed using the 3M Fit Test Kit FT-31 (3M Canada Company, Ontario, Canada) (denatonium benzoate solution)  Similar to previous studies, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] the clinical presentations of this case may be due to an asthma exacerbation through exposure to irritants or sensitization to denatonium benzoate\n",

      "Summary   The patients marked on the line the point that they felt represented their perception of their current state, such as dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, oral pain during rest, oral pain at a mealtimes, taste disorder, loss of appetite, sleep disorder, depressive mood and jitteriness This study included nine Japanese patients (4 males and 5 females) with OLP who were positive for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) and who visited our clinic at the Kurume University Hospital in Japan from November 2, 2011 to November 16, 2011  REFRECARE-H ® is an oral care gel (therapeutic dentifrice) containing hinokitiol which can remove stains on the teeth and general oral debris, and is effective in the prevention of breath odor and gum diseases (periodontal infection and gingival inflammation) There are few reports showing that the lesions or symptoms of OLP decrease the quality of life for OLP patients with HCV-related liver disease [12]   REFRECARE-H ® , an oral care gel with efficacy against Candida albicans, improved the quality of life for OLP patients  The results of this study indicate that the use of REFRE-CARE-H ® could be effective in reducing the subjective symptoms and quality of life of patients with OLP  Subjective evaluations of oral pain at a mealtimes and taste disorder improved 30 days after the application of REFRECARE-H ® (P = 0  Subjective evaluations of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness and sleep disorders significantly improved 30 days after the application of REFRE-CARE-H ® (P = 0  HCV-infected patients treated with IFN therapy should be managed by intensive oral care because of lower resistance to infection during the therapy  In particular, chronic erosive OLP is a painful disease inducing severe disability with weight loss and poor quality of life\n",
